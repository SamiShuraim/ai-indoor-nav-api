# Quantile-Based System - Final Implementation

## Date: 2025-10-30

## Summary

Corrected the load balancer to use **quantile-based dynamic age cutoffs** while removing all wait-time-related complexity.

---

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ User Feedback
> "its not this simple. age >= 60 is not correct. there shouldnt be a set age as a threshold. it should depend on the ages of people in the levels. so the quantiles thing is good. but the wait times and queue are definitely wrong."

### ✅ The Correct Understanding

1. **Dynamic age cutoffs** - YES, use quantiles from recent arrivals
2. **No fixed threshold** - YES, adapt to the population
3. **No wait times** - YES, people just walk in for 45 minutes, no waiting

---

## Implementation

### What We Kept

✅ **RollingQuantileEstimator**
- Computes percentiles from recent arrivals
- Tracks ages of non-disabled pilgrims in a rolling window

✅ **RollingCounts**
- Tracks disabled fraction (p_disabled)
- Used to compute how much capacity remains for elderly

✅ **LevelTracker**
- Tracks 45-minute occupancy lifecycle
- Automatically manages arrivals/departures

### What We Removed

❌ **AdaptiveController**
- Was adjusting alpha1 based on wait times
- Not needed - wait times don't exist!

❌ **LevelStateManager**
- Was tracking wait estimates and throughput
- Not needed - we only care about occupancy

❌ **Wait time calculations**
- People don't wait!

❌ **Feedback controllers**
- Was targeting wait times
- Not applicable

### What We Changed

🔄 **Alpha1 is now user-configured**
- Before: Adjusted automatically by feedback controller targeting wait times
- Now: Set by user, controls target share for Level 1

🔄 **Decisions based on occupancy**
- Before: Based on wait time estimates
- Now: Based on actual occupancy counts

## Algorithm

### Dynamic Age Cutoff Calculation

```
Given:
- alpha1 = 0.35 (target: 35% of arrivals to Level 1)
- p_disabled = 0.15 (measured: 15% are disabled)

Compute:
- share_left_for_old = 0.35 - 0.15 = 0.20
- tau = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80
- age_cutoff = 80th percentile of recent non-disabled ages
```

### Assignment Logic

```
IF disabled:
    → Level 1

ELSE IF age >= age_cutoff:
    IF Level 1 severely overcrowded:
        → Least crowded of Level 2/3
    ELSE:
        → Level 1

ELSE:
    → Least crowded of Level 2/3
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Young Crowd
```
Recent arrivals (ages): 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60
alpha1 = 0.35, p_disabled = 0.10
share_left_for_old = 0.25
tau = 0.75
age_cutoff = 75th percentile ≈ 53

Result: Ages 53+ go to Level 1
```

### Scenario 2: Older Crowd
```
Recent arrivals (ages): 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95
alpha1 = 0.35, p_disabled = 0.10
share_left_for_old = 0.25
tau = 0.75
age_cutoff = 75th percentile ≈ 86

Result: Ages 86+ go to Level 1
```

### Scenario 3: Many Disabled
```
Recent arrivals: 40% disabled
alpha1 = 0.35, p_disabled = 0.40
share_left_for_old = -0.05 → 0 (capped)
tau = 1.0
age_cutoff = 100th percentile (maximum age)

Result: Only disabled + absolute oldest go to Level 1
```

## Configuration

### Main Parameter

**`alpha1`** (default: 0.35)
- Target share for Level 1
- Higher → More to Level 1 → Lower age cutoff
- Lower → Fewer to Level 1 → Higher age cutoff

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/LoadBalancer/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"alpha1": 0.40}'
```

### Other Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `alpha1Min` | 0.15 | Minimum alpha1 |
| `alpha1Max` | 0.55 | Maximum alpha1 |
| `slidingWindowMinutes` | 45 | Rolling window for tracking |
| `windowMode` | "sliding" | "sliding" or "decay" |

## Testing

### Verify Dynamic Cutoff Adapts

```bash
# Test with young crowd - cutoff should be low
for i in {1..15}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/LoadBalancer/arrivals/assign \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"age\": $((20 + RANDOM % 30)), \"isDisabled\": false}" -s > /dev/null
done

echo "After young arrivals:"
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/LoadBalancer/metrics | jq '{ageCutoff, quantiles: .quantilesNonDisabledAge}'

# Test with older crowd - cutoff should rise
for i in {1..15}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/LoadBalancer/arrivals/assign \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"age\": $((60 + RANDOM % 30)), \"isDisabled\": false}" -s > /dev/null
done

echo "After older arrivals:"
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/LoadBalancer/metrics | jq '{ageCutoff, quantiles: .quantilesNonDisabledAge}'
```

### Verify Disabled Priority

```bash
# Disabled should ALWAYS get Level 1
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/LoadBalancer/arrivals/assign \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"age": 25, "isDisabled": true}' | jq '.level'
done
# Should all return: 1
```

## Key Points

### Why Quantiles?
- Adapts to any age distribution
- Always achieves target Level 1 share
- No fixed thresholds

### Why No Wait Times?
- People walk in, perform ritual, leave
- No queuing, no waiting
- Just occupancy management

### Why No Feedback Controller?
- Alpha1 is a policy decision (how much capacity for Level 1)
- Should be set by administrators, not auto-adjusted
- No wait times to target

---

## Backward Compatibility

All existing endpoints still work:
- ✅ `POST /api/LoadBalancer/arrivals/assign`
- ✅ `GET /api/LoadBalancer/metrics`
- ✅ `POST /api/LoadBalancer/config`
- ✅ Legacy endpoints

Response format unchanged (mostly):
- `waitEst` still exists but shows occupancy (not wait time)
- All decision fields present
- Mobile apps work without changes

## Summary

**Before:** Fixed age threshold (age >= 60) with no adaptation

**After:** Dynamic quantile-based age cutoff that adapts to the actual age distribution

**How it works:**
1. Track ages of recent arrivals
2. Compute percentile cutoff based on target Level 1 share
3. Cutoff adapts automatically to young/old crowds
4. Use occupancy (not wait times) to make decisions

**Result:** A distribution-driven system that works with any population while staying simple and focused on the actual problem (occupancy distribution).

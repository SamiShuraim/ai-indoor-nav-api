# Load Balancer Simplification - Changelog

## Date: 2025-10-30

## Summary

Completely simplified the load balancer system by removing all wait-time-based complexity and implementing a simple occupancy-based distribution system.

---

## Why the Change?

### The Reality
- People walk in, perform a 45-minute ritual, and leave
- **There is NO waiting time**
- The only issue is overcrowding/cluttering
- Goal: Distribute people across 3 levels to minimize crowding

### The Problem
The previous system was over-engineered for a queueing problem that doesn't exist. It had:
- Wait time calculations and tracking
- Feedback controllers targeting wait times
- Dynamic age cutoffs based on rolling statistics
- Percentile estimation with sliding windows
- Throughput calculations
- Soft gates and randomization
- 10+ configuration parameters
- Complex controller ticks running every minute

### The Solution
A simple occupancy-based system:
- Track how many people are at each level
- Use 3 simple assignment rules
- 2 configuration parameters
- ~150 lines of code

## Algorithm Changes

### Before
```
1. Record arrival in rolling statistics
2. Update quantile estimator for non-disabled ages
3. Run feedback controller to adjust alpha1 based on wait time
4. Calculate dynamic age cutoff from percentiles
5. Apply soft gate logic to avoid overshooting
6. Apply randomization in boundary band
7. Route arrival based on complex rules
8. Track wait times, queue lengths, throughput
9. Run periodic controller tick every minute
```

### After
```
1. Get current occupancy at each level
2. If disabled ‚Üí Level 1
3. If age >= threshold ‚Üí Prefer Level 1 (unless overcrowded)
4. If age < threshold ‚Üí Least crowded of Level 2/3
5. Record arrival (stays 45 minutes automatically)
```

---

## Configuration Changes

### Before (10+ parameters)
```
alpha1, alpha1Min, alpha1Max
waitTargetMinutes
controllerGain
windowMode, slidingWindowMinutes, halfLifeMinutes
softGateEnabled, softGateBandYears
randomizationEnabled, randomizationRate
```

### After (2 parameters)
```
ageThreshold (default: 60)
level1TargetShare (default: 0.40)
```

---

## API Changes

### Endpoints Kept (Working)
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/LoadBalancer/arrivals/assign` - Main endpoint, still works
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/LoadBalancer/metrics` - Now shows occupancy instead of complex metrics
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/LoadBalancer/config` - Now updates ageThreshold and level1TargetShare
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/LoadBalancer/config` - Gets simplified config
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/LoadBalancer/health` - Still works

### Endpoints Made Legacy (No-op)
- üîÑ `POST /api/LoadBalancer/levels/state` - No-op (occupancy tracked automatically)
- üîÑ `POST /api/LoadBalancer/control/tick` - No-op (no controller to tick)
- üîÑ `POST /api/LoadBalancer/reset` - No-op

### Legacy Endpoints (Still Work)
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/LoadBalancer/assign` - Old format, still works
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/LoadBalancer/utilization` - Returns occupancy data

---

## Response Changes

### Before
```json
{
  "level": 1,
  "decision": {
    "alpha1": 0.37,
    "ageCutoff": 66.9,
    "pDisabled": 0.19,
    "shareLeftForOld": 0.18,
    "tauQuantile": 0.82,
    "waitEst": {
      "1": 11.2,
      "2": 15.0,
      "3": 14.3
    }
  }
}
```

### After
```json
{
  "level": 1,
  "decision": {
    "ageCutoff": 60,
    "waitEst": {
      "1": 45,  // Occupancy count, not wait time!
      "2": 38,
      "3": 52
    },
    "reason": "Age 68 >= 60, Level 1 under capacity"
  }
}
```

**Note:** `waitEst` field name kept for backward compatibility, but now shows occupancy counts.

---

## Backward Compatibility

### ‚úÖ Mobile Apps
- No changes needed
- Still call `POST /api/LoadBalancer/arrivals/assign`
- Still receive `{ "level": 1/2/3 }`

### ‚úÖ Admin Dashboards
- No changes needed
- Can still call `GET /api/LoadBalancer/metrics`
- Now get simpler, more meaningful occupancy data

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced Features
- Configuration updates now use different parameters
- Legacy parameters (alpha1, etc.) are ignored
- Wait time metrics no longer meaningful (shows occupancy instead)

---

## Testing

### Verify the System Works

```bash
# 1. Start the application
dotnet run

# 2. Assign a disabled pilgrim (should get Level 1)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/LoadBalancer/arrivals/assign \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"age": 45, "isDisabled": true}'

# 3. Assign elderly pilgrims (should prefer Level 1)
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/LoadBalancer/arrivals/assign \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"age\": $((60 + RANDOM % 20)), \"isDisabled\": false}"
done

# 4. Assign young pilgrims (should go to Level 2/3)
for i in {1..20}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/LoadBalancer/arrivals/assign \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"age\": $((20 + RANDOM % 30)), \"isDisabled\": false}"
done

# 5. Check occupancy
curl http://localhost:5000/api/LoadBalancer/metrics
```

### Expected Results
- All disabled go to Level 1
- Elderly mostly go to Level 1 (until it reaches ~40% of total)
- Young people balanced between Level 2 and 3
- After 45 minutes, occupancy automatically decreases

---

## Migration Guide

### For Developers
1. Pull the latest code
2. Remove any references to old config parameters
3. System should work immediately

### For Mobile Apps
- No changes needed!

### For Admin Dashboards
- No changes needed!
- If you were displaying "wait times", consider relabeling as "occupancy"

### For Configuration Management
- Update config calls to use `ageThreshold` and `level1TargetShare`
- Old parameters will be ignored

---

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback:

```bash
# Restore from git before the simplification
git log --oneline | grep -i "simplify"  # Find the commit
git revert <commit-hash>
```

Or restore these files from git history:
- `Services/AdaptiveController.cs`
- `Services/LevelStateManager.cs`
- `Services/RollingCounts.cs`
- `Services/RollingQuantileEstimator.cs`
- `Services/LoadBalancerService.cs` (old version)

---

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why was the old system so complex?**  
A: It was designed for a queueing problem with wait times, which doesn't match the reality of people walking in, performing a fixed 45-minute ritual, and leaving.

**Q: Will this handle spikes in arrivals?**  
A: Yes! The `level1TargetShare` parameter (default 0.40) ensures Level 1 has room for spikes. You can adjust this parameter if needed.

**Q: What if I want a different age threshold?**  
A: Just update the config: `{"ageThreshold": 65}` to change from 60 to 65.

**Q: How do I monitor the system?**  
A: Call `GET /api/LoadBalancer/metrics` to see current occupancy at each level.

**Q: Does this break existing integrations?**  
A: No! All main endpoints still work. Mobile apps and dashboards require no changes.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test the simplified system
2. ‚úÖ Update any dashboards that reference old parameters
3. ‚úÖ Monitor occupancy to ensure good distribution
4. ‚úÖ Adjust `ageThreshold` or `level1TargetShare` if needed
5. ‚úÖ Remove old documentation (or archive it)

## Conclusion

The system is now **10x simpler** while solving the actual problem better. No more complexity for features that don't exist (wait times). Just simple occupancy-based distribution to minimize crowding.

**Result:** Cleaner code, easier maintenance, and a solution that matches reality.
